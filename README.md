## Summary
- Models for sets released since 2021 (training data from 17lands datasets)
- Provides a recommended pick order based on the current collection (of previous picks)
- Recommendations for pack-1 pick-1 pick order is similar to GIH winrate from 17lands 
- Synergy adjustment accounts for color, archetype, speculation, and splash potential
- Models are portable, with a training time of <20 minutes/dataset and inference time of <1ms/pick
